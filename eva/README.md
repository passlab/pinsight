## Evaluation in terms functionality and overhead with other performance tools

### Measurement evaluation
To compare with existing performance measurement tools, including Score-P, TAU, HPCToolkit, Intel VTune, and ARM MAP. 
We will collect the following metrics between PInsight with those tools using LULESH/other proxy-app, Jacobi, NPB/spec omp, 
 * full-trace overhead, 
 * dynamic-trace overhead, 
 * full-stack trace overhead, 
 * trace file sizes.
