# This is the config file for specifying the tracing behavior for the lexgions
# So far, PInsight recognizes the following keys (defined in lexgion_trace_config.h file):

# static const char *lexgion_trace_config_keys[] = {
#        "trace_enabled",          //true or false: for the first and global check before others, default TRUE
#        "ompt_trace_enabled",     //true or false: to enable/disable OpenMP trace, default TRUE
#        "pmpi_trace_enabled",     //true or false: to enable/disable MPI trace, default FALSE
#        "cupti_trace_enabled",    //true or false: to enable/disable CUDA trace, default FALSE
#        "trace_starts_at",        //integer: the number of execution of the region before tracing starts.
#        "initial_trace_count",    //integer: the number of traces to be collected after the trace starts the first time
#        "max_num_traces",         //integer: total number of traces to be collected
#        "tracing_rate",           //integer: the rate an execution is traced, e.g. 10 for 1 trace per 10 execution of the region.
# };

# Restrictions for using those keys to provide configuration:
# 1) The value for each of the keys could be either an integer, TRUE or FALSE.
# 2) Each setting should use one line and only one setting is allowed in a line.
# 3) When providing the setting, e.g. trace_enabled = TRUE, at least one whitespace is required
#    before and after the '='.

# The default section of the config provides settings for those that are not specified explicitly in the config file
