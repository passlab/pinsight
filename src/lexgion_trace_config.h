/**
 * Runtime configuration and reconfiguration of tracing is critical to truly enable dynamic,
 * region-specific and low-overhead tracing. To support this feature, the design needs to
 * consider 1) config/reconfig scope, i.e. what can/should be reconfigured,
 *          2) what configuration options can be used for each scope,
 *          3) when the reconfiguration should be applied,
 *          4) how the reconfiguration should be specified, and
 *          5) how to support efficient implementation
 *
 * For what can/should be configured, there are four scopes, from high level to low level,
 * that tracing configuration can be applied to:
 *   1. Domain scope, e.g. MPI, OMP, CUDA, Backtrace, and Energy can be reconfigured completely
 *   2. Event scope, i.e. specific event within a domain, e.g. OMP barrier, MPI_Bcast, CUDA Memcpy, etc can be reconfigured
 *   3. TPD scope, TPD stands for thread/process/device. For this scope, we can configure tracing for specific threads, processes or accelerator devices
 *   4. Lexgion scope, which is a specific code region identified via codeptr that can be add2lined to sourceFile:lineNumber.
 *      A lexgion can have multiple events from the same or different domains.
 *
 * For configuration options:
 * For the first three scopes, the option is either enabled or disabled. For the lexgion scope, the options are
 * disabled, counted tracing, and uncounted tracing. Counted tracing allows trace only specific amount of traces for a code
 * region, thus reducing the redundant tracing and overhead. Counted tracing requires internal book-keeping (for counting)
 * that involves array lookup, thus overhead is high compared with uncounted tracing.
 * But controlling the amount of tracing often reduces much more overhead than the overhead introduced by counting.
 * Uncounted tracing, which is by tracing all the events of the lexgion without internal book-keeping for lookup and counting,
 * is simple to implement and has low overhead of tracing.
 *
 * Thus for each scope, the options that are available are:
 *   1. Domain scope:  disabled and enabled
 *   2. Event scope:   disabled and enabled
 *   3. TPD scope:     Specified by numbers
 *   4. Lexgion scope: disabled, counted and uncounted
 *
 * For when to apply reconfiguration, considering the following points of execution of a program:
 *    1. When the program starts,
 *    2. pre-defined reconfiguration point, e.g. counted tracing will need to change the configuration
 *       when traces reach max count
 *    3. through signal handler, and
 *    4. debug breakpoint
 *
 * For how the configuration should be specified, the following two options can be used to provide configuration setting:
 *    1. via environment variable, and
 *    2. via config file.
 *
 * For implementation, we need to consider the following:
 *    1. Data structure for storing the configuration object,
 *    2. Functions for updating the configuration object, and
 *    3. Functions for apply the configuration.
 *    4. Knobs (functions) for initiate configuration/reconfiguration
 *    5. For the order of checking configuration, inside a tracing function, e.g.  an OMP callback,
 *       it should first check domain configuration, then TPD configuration, and the event configuration,
 *       and then lexgion configuration
 *    6. Tracing configuration takes effects on per process/thread-basis such that every thread process
 *       tracing control by itself. But configuration setting are applied globally.

/**
 * the struct for storing trace config of a lexgion. trace config can be updated at the runtime so PInsight can do dynamic
 * tracing. Each time, PInsight needs to check the config of a lexgion, it checks the lexgion_trace_config object
 * to find out the current trace rate, etc.
 *
 * All threads share a single config for each lexgion. Thus for each lexgion, tracing behavior for all threads are the same.
 * 
 * This struct is used for providing configuration for tracing a lexgion, which could be an OpenMP/MPI/CUPTI region
 * Each lexgion has an object of it and there is an global object of this struct as well to provide the default configuration.
 *
 * For each lexgion, the configuration can be viewed as key-value pairs and the configuration
 * file should be written in the format similar to, but simpler than INI or TOML format.
 *
 * In this implementation, there are two restrictions: 1) each field of this struct MUST be "int" type, and
 * 2) the fields in lexgion_trace_config MUST BE in the same order as the keys defined in the lexgion_trace_config_keys[].
 * This is designed to simplify parsing a configuration file to read the configuration values. With this restriction,
 * to add, remove or change a config option, you need to follow the two restriction to change the NUM_CONFIG_KEYS,
 * lexgion_trace_config_keys, and lexgion_trace_config. And then modify the lexgion_trace_config_sysdefault function for
 * the changes. With that, we do not need to change the code for reading the config file.
 *
 * The system default of the config represents the features that are enabled when the library is built.
 * The default value for each feather key (*_enabled) is set according to whether the feature is enabled
 * when this library is built. A feature can only be enabled at the runtime if it is default enabled (which means the
 * library is built to support this feature). Thus if a feature is not enabled by system default, it cannot be enabled by runtime
 * configuration.
