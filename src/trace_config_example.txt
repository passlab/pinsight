# ================================= Configuration file Specification ================================================
# A trace config file is in an enhanced INIT file format. In this format, 
# # is for a line of comments. [section] is for specifying a section, which is a 
# configuration of a domain.punit or lexgion. The name of the section can be either 
# the name of a domain.punit or lexgion. The format of the section name includes three parts separated by colons (:),
# e.g. OpenMP.thread(0-3): OpenMP.default: MPI.rank(0), CUDA.device(0). The first part is the domain.punit specification
# which is in the format of <domain_name>[.<punit_name>(<punit_range>)]+ or <domain_name>.default, or lexgion(<code_ptr>).
# The second part is the domain configuration inheritence, which is in the format of [<domain_name>.default]*. For 
# lexgion, it could inherit from multiple domains' default configuration, separated by commas (,). punit_range can 
# be a single number, a range of numbers, or a list of numbers, separated by commas (,) e.g. 4, 6, 8-12, 14-16, 20-24
# The third part is the punit configuration for other domains, which is in the format of 
# <domain_name>.<punit_kind>(<punit_range>) and multiple <domain_name>.<punit_kind>(<punit_range>), one per domain, can be specified, separated by commas (,)
# The content/data of each section is the key-value pairs. For the <domain_name>.default section, it allows to have 
# <domain_name>.punit(low-high) format to specify the punit range for the domain. The key-value data content for each 
# domain section are used to specifying whether the events of the domain are enabled or disabled (on and off). For the 
# lexgion section, the key-value pairs are used to specifying the lexgion configuration, which includes the tracing rate, 
# max number of traces, and the tracing start point.

# Parsing this file needs to fill in the domain_trace_config_table and lexgion_trace_config_table. The <domain_name>.default
# section is used to specify the default configuration for the domain, which will fill in each object of the domain_trace_config_table
# The <domain_name>.punit(low-high) sections will then need to be parsed to fill in the punit_trace_config objects established as a link list via 
# the next pointer. Filling in those table/link list needs to refer to the domain_info_table to make sure the domain name, 
# punit name are already initialized in the domain_info table. The <domain_name>.punit(low-high) section in domain.default section needs to be parsed
# and to replace the low-high field of the cooresponding domain_info_table entry for the punit. lexgion secitons 
# should be parsed to fill in the lexgion_trace_config_table according to the mapping between the section specification and 
# the data structure of lexgion_trace_config_t object.
