# This is the config file for specifying the tracing behavior for the lexgions
# So far, PInsight recognizes the following keys (defined in lexgion_trace_config.h file):

#static const char *lexgion_trace_config_keys[] = {
#        "OpenMP_trace_enabled",    //true or false: to enable/disable OpenMP trace
#        "MPI_trace_enabled",       //true or false: to enable/disable MPI trace
#        "CUDA_trace_enabled",      //true or false: to enable/disable CUDA trace
#        "ENERGY_trace_enabled",    //true or false: to enable/disable energy tracing
#        "BACKTRACE_enabled",       //true or false: to enable/disable backtrace.
#        "trace_starts_at",         //integer: the number of execution of the region before tracing starts. 
#        "initial_trace_count",     //integer: the number of traces to be collected after the trace starts the first time
#        "max_num_traces",          //integer: total number of traces to be collected
#        "tracing_rate",            //integer: the rate an execution is traced, e.g. 10 for 1 trace per 10 execution of the region. 
#};

# Restrictions for using those keys to provide configuration:
# 1) The value for each of the keys can only be an integer, TRUE or FALSE.
# 2) Each setting should use one line and only one setting is allowed in a line.
# 3) When providing the setting, e.g. trace_enabled = TRUE, at least one whitespace is required
#    before and after the '='.
# 4) A feature (OMP, MPI, CUDA, ENERGY, BACKTRACE) can only be enabled if the library is built to support it. 

# The default section of the config provides settings for those options that are not specified explicitly in the config file for each lexgion
