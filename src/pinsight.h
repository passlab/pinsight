/**
 * A lexgion (lexical region) is a region in the source code that has its footprint in
 * the runtime, e.g. a parallel region, a worksharing region, master/single region, task
 * region, target region, etc. lexgion in OpenMP are mostly translated to runtime calls.
 *
 * For MPI, each MPI method represents a lexgion
 *
 * There are so far six classes of lexgion, defined in LEXGION_CLASS_t enum. So far, we aim to implement
 * MPI_LEXGION, OPENMP_LEXGION, and CUDA_LEXGION
 *
 * A lexgion should be identified by the codeptr, the type and class together. codeptr is the binary address of the
 * first instruction of the lexgion (retun address of the runtime call), e.g. codeptr_ra in OMPT, return address of
 * an MPI call, etc. end_codeptr_ra is the binary address at the end of the lexgion, which could be the same as codeptr.
 *
 * About the codeptr_ra of different regions of OpenMP when using OMPT, check the OpenMP 5.0 standard and
 * https://github.com/passlab/pinsight/issues/41. Issues/41 includes the following info:
 *
 * For parallel, codeptr_ra for parallel_begin, parallel_end, AND barrier_begin, wait_barrier_begin,
 * wait_barrier_end and barrier_end of the implicit join barrier of the MASTER thread are the same.
 * For non-master thread, codeptr of barrier-related events for parallel join is the same, and it is NULL.
 * Thus, the codeptr_ra and end_codeptr_ra field of the lexgion objects for those are the same.
 *
 * For for (omp for or omp parallel for), master, and single, codeptr for scope_begin and score_end are different,
 * Thus codeptr and end_codeptr of the lexgion are different.
 * For master, only master thread will trigger the events. For single, all threads will trigger the events.
 *
 * for parallel for, codeptr for parallel_begin and work_begin (loop_begin) are different.
 * For single with barrier, the codeptr for single-related events and for the barrier-related events are different.
 *
 * For explicit barrier or barrier with for/single, codeptr for both begin and end events are all the same, not NULL.
 *
 * The reasons we need type for identify a lexgion are:
 * 1). OpenMP combined and composite construct, e.g. parallel for
 * 2). implicit barrier, e.g. parallel.
 * Because of that, the events for those constructs may use the same codeptr_ra for the callback, thus we need further
 * check the type so we know whether we need to create two different lexgion objects
 *
 * This is per-thread data structure, i.e. for the same code region, an object is created for each thread when it is needed.
 * No two threads share the same object of the same code region
 * */
